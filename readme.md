## Backend

### Setup Project

Initialize the Node.js project and install dependencies:

```bash
npm init
npm install express typeorm jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
```

# Database Configuration

Set up a connection to the database using TypeORM. Create entities for BlogPosts, Users, etc.

# Authentication

Implement user registration and login routes using JWT for token-based authentication. Apply 2-level password hashing using bcryptjs.

# Blogging Functionality

Implement CRUD operations for blog posts. Ensure that only authenticated users can create, update, or delete their blog posts.

# Middleware

Create middleware to check JWT tokens for authentication.

# Error Handling

Implement error handling for better user feedback.

# Testing

Write unit tests for your routes and functions.

# Frontend

Setup Project (Frontend)
Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-blog-app --typescript
```

# API Integration

Use Next.js API routes to connect with your backend. Implement functions for fetching and displaying blog posts.

# Authentication Flow

Create login and registration pages. Use cookies or local storage to store JWT tokens.

# Blogging Interface

Build a page for displaying blog posts. Implement a form for creating and updating blog posts.

# Routing

Set up routing for different pages and blog posts.

# Styling

Style your components using CSS or a styling library (e.g., styled-components).

# Error Handling (Frontend)

Implement error handling for API calls and form submissions.

# Testing (Frontend)

Test your components and pages.

# Additional Considerations

## Deployment

Deploy your backend on a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting service). Deploy your frontend using Vercel or another hosting service.

## Security

Ensure proper security measures, like HTTPS, are in place. Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Scalability

Optimize your database queries for performance. Consider caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
